    description: |
      This section contains QC images for EDDY correction, which is used to correct distortions and motion artifacts. The animation shows a before-and-after comparison of the correction. To assess the quality of the correction, focus on areas prone to distortions, such as the frontal lobe and the cerebellum/spinal cord region. Look for reduced geometric warping, improved alignment with anatomical boundaries, and correction of eddy-current-induced displacements. Additionally, ensure that no new artifacts or excessive blurring are introduced in the corrected images.
