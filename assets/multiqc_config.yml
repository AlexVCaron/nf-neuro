    section_name: "Registration of anatomical image in DWI space QC"
    description: |
      This section contains QC images for the registration of the T1-weighted
      structural image to diffusion space, using the b0 image as a reference.
      This step ensures accurate alignment between structural and diffusion
      data. To assess the quality of the registration, check for good alignment
      of anatomical structures. Specifically, look for proper overlay of cortical
      and subcortical structures without excessive warping, stretching,
      or misalignment. Pay particular attention to boundaries such as the
      ventricles and major white matter tracts, ensuring they match well
      between the T1-weighted and b0 images. If misalignment is present,
      consider flagging this specific subject for further review.
